# Information Retrieval and Text Mining course (DAT640), 2021 fall edition, University of Stavanger

This repository contains course material (lectures, labs, and assignments) for the 2021 fall edition of the course.

## Course format

The course followed a **flipped classroom** format, where students were expected to learn the course material independently and asynchronously prior the in-class sessions, by watching pre-recorded lecture videos and reading the textbook/notes/articles.  Classroom time was devoted to active learning, including discussions and answering questions, laboratory exercises, and assignments.

The semester (consisting of 13 weeks) was divided into two periods, with [lectures](lectures/) and [individual assignments](assignments/) during the first ten weeks and [group project work](project/) during the last three weeks.
Dedicated time was provided to get help with the individual assignments (from TA) as well as to get feedback on the group project (from lecturer and TA).

### Grading

The overall grade came from two components, both of which needed to be >F in order to pass:

  * 40% Project work. Half of the score came from the [individual assignments](assignments/) and another half from the [group project](project/).
  * 60% Written (digital) exam.
