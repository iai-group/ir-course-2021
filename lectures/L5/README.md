# L5: Advanced retrieval models

This module presents a range of more advanced retrieval approaches. We start with methods for creating a more accurate representation of the user's underlying information need, in the form of expanded query models. Next, we discuss techniques specific to Web search, and in particular, how to utilize hyperlinks on the Web. Finally, we look at how to use machine learning for information retrieval, that is, how to learn retrieval functions, in the presence of labeled training data.
