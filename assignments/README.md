# Assignments (general information)


During the course, you need to complete a number of assignments (deliverables) individually. These are graded and account for 50% of the project work (i.e., 20% of the final grade).

## General rules

  * You are given a certain time limit (typically 10 days) to complete each assignment. You need to upload your solution to Canvas before the indicated deadline.
  * Deadlines are strict, no extensions, no exceptions!
  * We have a zero-tolerance policy for cheating. Copying someone else's solution, even in part, will be considered plagiarism and may result in failing the whole course.
  * There is no requirement on solving all assignments, it's the overall points that matters. The individual assignments and the group project together (weighted equally) constitute the project work component of the course, which needs to be a pass.

## General instructions

### Provided information


For each assignment we provide the following files:

  * `.py` Python file which you are expected to complete and upload to Canvas.
  * `README.md` file with the task description and additional information regarding the assignment.
  * `requirements.txt` containing the libraries needed to be able to complete the assignment.
  * `test_public.py` file containing some of the tests you will be graded on. If these tests pass, you likely have the correct solution.

### How to solve each assignment

  * Make sure to carefully read and follow the instructions.
  * Do not change the name or signature of the functions inside the provided file, as they will be referenced in the tests. You may, however, create new functions if it helps you organize the code better.
  * Each assignment may specify which libraries may or may not be used. Unless stated otherwise, only libraries that are part of the standard Anaconda distribution (i.e., the base environment of Anaconda without additional libraries installed) may be imported.
  * In general, keep in mind that your code must be able to run correctly on another computer.
  * Unless stated otherwise, your entire solution should complete within a few minutes. If your solution is more time-consuming than that, even if a test would pass eventually, your submission may lose marks.
  * To test your solution locally, before submitting, you can navigate to the folder containing your solution and the test file and issue `pytest test_public.py`.
  * Since we are not using Jupyter notebooks for the assignments, it is recommended to solve them using a good IDE (like VSCode, PyCharm, or Spider).

### How submissions are graded

  * Assignments are graded automatically, using a combination of public and hidden tests. Public tests are released together with the assignment; if your solution passes these tests, it is likely correct. However, in addition to those tests, there will be some hidden tests that your solution will be tested against after submission; these typically contain larger inputs/datasets, corner cases, or other inputs in order to test that you fully understood the methods and/or followed the instructions.
  * For every public test, it is stated in the comments how many points that test case is worth. Points are awarded in an all-or-nothing manner, i.e., either you get the full points for a test case or none. For hidden tests, only the total number of points is known (that is, can be inferred from the total points).

### How to ask for help

  * When you are unsure and have made a reasonable effort to solve a problem you are stuck on, the best option is to use the Lab sessions on Thursdays to get help with the assignment. This will solve your issue much faster, especially if you get started on the assignment as soon as it has been published.
  * Make sure you first check the discussion forum on Canvas as there may already be an answer. If not, consider posting your question there, so that your fellow students can also benefit from the answer. 
  * Troubleshooting over email is not only more time-consuming due to the time lag between question and response, but also because communication bandwidth is reduced. If you want help over email, make sure to explain clearly what you are trying to accomplish (i.e., the specific part of the assignment on which you are stuck) and summarize what you have tried already.
  * Allow enough time for us to respond! Do not expect responses outside normal working hours and during weekends.
